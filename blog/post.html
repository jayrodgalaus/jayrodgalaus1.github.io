                    <p>Still the same half-dreamy half-awake state. Zheng opened his eyes. This place wasn’t a forest as he had expected. This was a dark warehouse. It took for his eyes to adjust when he suddenly moved from the bright dimension to this dark warehouse. The warehouse was not big and had no items in sight. The floor though was quite clean. Three people lay on the floor. One guy and two girls. These were the newbies in this movie.</p>

                    <p>Xuan and the other two people had already observed the state of this room. Xuan said. “Do you hear anything coming from outside? Sounds like…”</p>

                    <p>“Vehicle engine?” They said at the same time and looked confused. Everyone immediately turned to Xuan.</p>

                    <p>However, he stared at the three people on the floor instead, waited for a while and said. “I thought of an issue. Even though we are only reviving the stronger members that used to be in team China, but what if the team surpassed twenty people? I don’t know what will happen but there are only twenty rooms in God’s dimension. The most probable result is one person will get erased during revival or the person that revives him gets erased. In the end, we will lose one important member.”</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Section Heading nanaman</h2>

                    <p>Zheng’s expression changed abruptly. He also thought of this possibility but couldn’t come up with any solutions. “There’s no option to refuse the entrance of newbies from God. We will probably reach this problem at some time. Do you have any solutions?”</p>

                    <p>Xuan adjusted his glasses. “One, kill off the useless members in a team. Two, complete all bonus missions we can think of in a movie and get enough points to revive all the important members before we reach twenty people. I believe enacting both options is the best.”</p>

                    <p>Zheng sighed. He looked at the three young people on the floor and muttered. “No, choose the second option. Complete as much bonus missions as possible. If that’s not enough, we can go back to previous movies to search for missions. We can get doubled rewards if we complete the next movie in the series in advance.”</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Isa Pa</h2>

                    <p>Xuan shook his head and said with an indifferent tone. “This isn’t cost effective. We have to spend rewards to unlock the worlds then five times the normal points to enter it. Furthermore, we are not guaranteed to encounter bonus missions. Even if we do, it will be at the highest difficulty. I don’t believe we have the strength to challenge most movies. I disagree with your choice.”</p>
